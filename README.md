# 🚀 Generative AI Image Analytics (Computer Vision + LLM)

## 📌 Project Overview

This project implements an AI-powered image analysis system using Large Language Models (LLMs) and computer vision techniques. It allows users to upload images and ask natural language queries to extract insights from visual content.

The system combines Generative AI with image-understanding capabilities to detect objects, interpret scenes, answer questions about images and generate intelligent descriptions.

## 🎯 Objectives

* Build an AI-based image understanding system

* Enable natural language interaction with images

* Perform automated visual analysis

* Extract semantic meaning from raw image data

* Demonstrate real-world use of multimodal Large Language Models

* Build a web-based interface for image analytics

---

## 🖼 1. Image Upload & Query Interface

Users can:

* Upload an image (PNG, JPG, JPEG)

* Type custom questions about the image

* Interact with the application in real-time

---

## 🔍 2. Vision-Based AI Analytics

The AI model performs:

* Object recognition

* Scene understanding

* Image captioning

* Visual reasoning

* Question answering

* Context interpretation

---

## ⚙️ 3. AI Processing Workflow

The workflow consists of:

1. User uploads image

2. User enters textual query

3. Image is encoded and transmitted securely

4. LLM processes visual content

5. Generated interpretation is displayed

6. Results are presented in natural language
